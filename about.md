My name is Scott Davidson, a software developer in the New England area. I enjoy learning more about software development and cybersecurity, and also love teaching and sharing my experiences with others.

I have created this blog for personal development. Clearly desribing the things I do significantly helps me gain a better understanding of how they work. Also, I find it fun to share what I've learned in the hopes of helping others.
