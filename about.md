My name is Scott Davidson, and I'm a software developer in the Seattle area. I created this blog to highlight my adventures investigating fun topics in software development, security, and more. I hope you enjoy / can learn a thing or two from my posts.

I'm usually always looking for new projects to work on, so please reach out if you'd like to potentially collaborate. 

Thanks for visiting. Enjoy!
