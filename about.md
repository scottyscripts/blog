My name is Scott Davidson, and I'm a software developer in the New England area. I enjoy learning more about the web, software development, and cybersecurity.

I have created this blog for personal development. Clearly desribing the things I do helps me gain a better understanding of how they work. While this blog is primarily for me, I hope that others can learn a thing or two from my posts!

Enjoy!
