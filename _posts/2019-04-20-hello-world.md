title:  "Hello World!"

I've seen so many `hello world` references that my brain automatically named this article before I put any thought into it. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit sick of this cliche, but I think it is a fitting title since this is my first post!

I got into the software industry a few years ago after working many odd jobs. I worked as an assistant for an after school program for elementary students, a supervisor at a movie theater, a nursing assistant, and a postman before I decided to attend General Assembly's Web Development Immersive bootcamp. Since then, I've gotten the chance to work as a full stack developer, educator, and an automation engineer. I've had the opportunity to learn a wide variety of skills from these different positions and have been fortunate enough to work with some really great people. I feel like I've come so far on my journey into this industry, but I still have so much more to learn.

In my spare time, I like learning more about web / software development, cybersecurity, Linux, and more. There are so many great resources available at little or no cost. I love taking online courses through services like Udemy or edx. Other times I will read a good book or just hack away on something that sparks my interest. I've worked on a lot of cool things in the last year and started to think that it would be a good idea to write about them. I figured that documenting the things I work on would be a good opportunity to help others learn (even if one person learns one new thing from my endeavors). It would be great for someone else to benefit off my documented journies, but my main motivation for doing this is self development.

While teaching, I learned that the best way to truly learn something is to explain it. It is one thing to understand how a language or framework works, but it's an entirely new challenge to articulate what you learned in a meaningful way. I will be using this blog as a way to strengthen my knowledge in my interests and take my learning to another level by explaining it through my future blog posts.

Even the planning involved in taking this initial step has helped me grow as a developer. I do hope that I can help and inspire others to do what they love along the way.
If you read this much of my post, I'd like to thank you for stopping by and encourage you to keep an eye out for future articles.
If nobody ever sees this, at least I know I'm having a blast.
